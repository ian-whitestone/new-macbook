# Other things to Setup

- iCloud
- vimrc: https://github.com/amix/vimrc

# Python

For some reason, Mac OS still ships with Python 2.7 (as of March 7, 2020). So install Python 3:

`brew install python3`

## pyenv

[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) pyenv lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. Install it with brew:

`brew install pyenv`

Validate the installation worked:

```bash
â†’ pyenv --version
pyenv 1.2.16
```

Now install Python 3.7.6, and set it so that it is the global Python.

```bash
pyenv install 3.7.6
pyenv global 3.7.6
```

Validate that worked properly by running:

```bash
â†’ python --version
Python 3.7.6

â†’ which python
/Users/ianwhitestone/.pyenv/shims/python
```


**Poetry**

Install poetry with:

`curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python`

Then add `source $HOME/.poetry/env` to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`, and then re-source your shell with `source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bash_profile`.
